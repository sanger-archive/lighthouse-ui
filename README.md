A [Nuxt JS](https://nuxtjs.org) application that provides SSRs the ability to interact with the [lighthouse service](https://github.com/sanger/lighthouse) and other LIMS. Some
of the features include:

- Create and download reports which contain the fit to pick samples and their locations.
- The ability to scan the barcode of a box or plate and get information about it, such as:
  - whether there is plate map data for the barcode(s).
  - the number of fit to pick samples.
  - the number of 'must_sequence' samples.
  - the number of 'preferentially_sequence' samples.
- Create samples in Sequencescape when scanning in a box - it retrieves the plates from LabWhere, then inserts the fit to pick samples into Sequencescape.

- Create a cherrypick batch from Sentinel - on scaning a box barcode, it retrieves the plates from LabWhere, then creates a cherrypick submission in Sequencescsape.
  It assumes that the samples are already in Sequencescape and also gives you an opportunity to deselect samples that you do not want to include.
- View the status of the CSV imports from the lighthouse service.
- Print labels.
- Create and fail plates in the Beckman pipeline.
